# Technical University of Crete - HPY201 - Project

This is a project I completed as an undergraduate student in a team of 2 members.

In the "code.zip" file you will find my team's implementation of a maze game in C and Assembly MIPS (using polling and interrupts).
Each implementation contains a README file with instructions on how to execute the program.

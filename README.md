# Technical University of Crete - HPY201 - Project

This is a project I completed as an undergraduate student in a team of 2 members.

In the "code.zip" file you will find my team's implementation of a maze game in C and Assembly MIPS (using polling and interrupts).

Each implementation contains a README file with instructions on how to execute the program.

In both implementations you can do the following:
1) Play the game by moving around with keys (W, A, S, D)
2) Request the program to find a path for you using key (E)
